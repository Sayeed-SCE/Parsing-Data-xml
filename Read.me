Mini Parsing project 
there is multiple version of the code block
parse-data.py is v1 which just generate the missed file to already existed text file, and the Folder 
and file paths are hard coded. 
parse_v2.py is v2 of the code which I changed the hardcoded paths for folder and files.
parse_v3.py is the new version of the code that generates two different typs of data 
one missed and matched data to an already existed text files in the project. 
parse_v4.py I had improved the code to generate a new text file for missed and matched data
by itself every time we run the code and name them orderly.
